PART III: Model Construction

In the third part, students will

finalize their data exploration stage (the dataset should be completely ready after appropriate cleansing and transformations; student 
is expected to be familiar with all the major patterns and trends in dataset) construct their model (i.e. if it is a regression problem, 
then students should have their codes ready that are compatible with the dataset; if it is a neural network implementation, then students 
should complete at least one successful training, etc.) 

By following the due date listed in the table below, students will

create 8-10 minutes long presentations providing the main outcomes of their data exploration and the details of their model
record their presentation and upload it to internet; share the links to their videos with the entire classroom via Blackboard Forums.
write a 2-page document summarizing the materials discussed in the presentation and upload it along with your code, data set, and presentation file to your github account (folder: Delivery-3)


Then students will have two days to

watch 3 of their classmates’ presentations and
write a review for each presentation
grade their classmates’ presentations (see below for more details about peer-grading)
Email both review and grade to the instructor ( simsek@umbc.edu )
