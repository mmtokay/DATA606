In the fourth and last part, students will

finalize analyzing their complete data set
come up with concrete outcomes (either their initial hypothesis work and why or â€œthese are the outcomes with this much prediction 
according to method-x, etc)
discuss the performance of their model (in terms of accuracy and/or confidence levels)
elaborate what could be differently or what can be done next

By following the due date listed in the table below, students will

create 12-15 minutes long presentations summarizing their entire capstone project (by spending at least half of the talk on the last 
month efforts, where the most advanced things are expected to happen)
record their presentation and upload it to internet; share the links to their videos with the entire classroom via Blackboard Forums.
Finalize their report by adding 2-3 new pages summarizing their last month efforts to their previous write-ups and upload it along with 
your code(s), data sets, presentation file to your github account(folder: Delivery-4)
Note that the final report will be structured as a typical research paper that includes three main sections as follows,
