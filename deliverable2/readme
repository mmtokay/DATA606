Due March 1st
PART II: Literature Review and EDA

In the second part, students will make a brief literature/industry research to determine similar projects to their project, learn from those studies’ outcomes,
differentiate their project than others.

In this part, students are also expected to get familiar with their datasets and carry out transformations and cleansing, if necessary, and
carry out exploratory data analysis on their data sets.

By following the due date listed in the table below, students will create 5-8 minutes long presentations providing a brief summary of similar approaches and their initial findings (the outcomes of their preliminary exploratory data analysis),
record their presentation and upload it to internet; share the links to their videos with the entire classroom via Blackboard Forums.
write a 1-page document summarizing the materials discussed in the presentation and upload it along with your code, data set, and presentation file to your github account (folder: Delivery-2)
Then students will have two days to watch 3 of their classmates’ presentations and write a review for each presentation grade their classmates’ presentations (see below for more details about peer-grading)
Email both review and grade to the instructor ( simsek@umbc.edu )
